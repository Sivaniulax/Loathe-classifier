# Loathe-classifier
Abstract of the Project: 
	This is a Hate Speech detector Machine learning and NLP project which detects the input into Hatespeech,Offensive Language and Not Hate. The Logistic regression model is developed with accuracy of 0.89 and web app is created and deployed  in Streamlit Python.
	
  
Tools and Technology used: Scikit-learn,Pipeline,Neatext,pickle,Streamlit,VScode,Jupyter


Description of the Task Completed:
	Data is collected from various sources (like Kaggle) and followed by data cleaning and visualization. Then using the Neatext library in NLP, data preparation is performed and the Model is formed and stored into a Pickle file by using a pipeline.  Additionally, the model is deployed and a web application is created using the Streamlit framework.
